# Diplotopia
## Description
A Nextflow pipeline for genetic analysis of diploid organisms.

This pipeline is currently under developpment.
Please see the wiki to see what is currently functional. 

For now it is primarely though for analysis of Saprolegnia isolates, but we develop it with flexibility in mind. 
These organism are highly challenging, as around 40% of their genome is repetitive. 


## Change log: 
2024-07-29: Migrated (and somewhat sorted) code and wiki that was ready to the present repository - added members - created team. 
2024-07-26: Created the repository. The code that has been so far developped for the pipeline needs to be migrated in this new public repository.
