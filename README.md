# Diplotopia

## Description
A Nextflow pipeline for genetic analysis of diploid organisms.

This pipeline is currently under development.
Please see the wiki to see what is currently functional. 

For now it is primarily though for analysis of Saprolegnia isolates, but we develop it with flexibility in mind. 
These organism are highly challenging, as around 40% of their genome is repetitive. 

## Documentation
> currently building as github pages (also some in wiki -[ ] need to be merged)
